### React Shoe App

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React. It includes features such as JSX rendering, Props passing, State management, Routing, and HTTP Requests to interact with a mock API.

This README file gives a structured overview of your React Shoe App project, covering its features, implementation details, known issues, and your review of the assignment. You can adjust the content as needed and include specific details about my implementation and challenges faced during development.

- **Custom Route**: [www.my-store.com/custom](www.my-store.com/custom)
  - Add any other custom route as per your choice.

#### Implementation Notes
- Utilizes JSX for component rendering and structuring.
- Props are passed down to child components for efficient data handling.
- State management is used for handling component-level states.
- React Router is implemented for routing and navigation within the app.
- CRUD operations are performed using HTTP requests to the mock API.


#### Review
Overall, this project provided a great opportunity to practice key concepts of React development, including handling APIs, routing, and state management. The mock API was instrumental in simulating real-world interactions and testing CRUD functionalities. While the project was challenging at times,im trying learning and hopefully in the future I will get better.
